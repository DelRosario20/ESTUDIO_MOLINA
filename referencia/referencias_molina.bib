   abstract = {This paper analyzes the dynamic impact of remittances on financial development for emerging and developing countries over the period 1974–2014 employing a Pooled Mean Group (PMG) approach. With three panels differentiated by level of income, our results show that a positive long-run relationship between remittances and financial development coexists with a significant (and slightly positive) short-run relationship, except for low-income countries. Consequently, there is strong evidence supporting the view that remittances promote financial development in developing countries in the long term, but the effect may be different in the short term. We offer some financial and economic explanations for these findings.},

   abstract = {Expatriate workers’ remittances represent an important source of financing for low- and middle-income countries. No consensus, however, has yet emerged regarding the effect of remittances on economic growth. In a quantitative survey of 538 estimates reported in 95 studies, we find that approximately 40% of the studies report a positive effect, 40% report no effect, and 20% report a negative effect. Our results indicate publication bias in favor of positive effects. Correcting for the bias using recently developed techniques, we find that the mean effect of remittances on growth is still positive but economically small. Nevertheless, our results uncover noticeable regional differences: remittances are growth-enhancing in Asia but not in Africa. Studies that do not control for alternative sources of external finance, such as foreign aid and foreign direct investment, mismeasure the effect of remittances. Finally, time-series studies and studies ignoring endogeneity issues report systematically larger effects of remittances on growth.},

   abstract = {Remittances in the world represent one of major international financial resources, which sometimes they exceed the flows of foreign direct investment (FDI). For centuries, there have been heated debates on the sources of economic growth in developing economies and also why some countries reflect strong economic growth comparing to others. This study aims to observe the impacts of remittances on economic growth, using panel data set of six high remittances receiving countries, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania and Bosnia Herzegovina during the period 1999–2013. These countries have experienced a major increase in remittance inflows, and at this time accounts for the bulk of total remittance receipts, compared with other regions. Most countries, remittances represent the largest source of foreign exchange earnings and represent more than 10 percent of GDP. In other words, the econometric analysis will be based on those six remittance receiving countries. The paper is then to review the empirical literature devoted to the impact of remittances on economic growth, in order, to identify empirically if there are significant relationships between remittances and growth in these countries. The results suggest that remittances have a positive impact on growth and that this impact increases at higher levels of remittances relative to GDP.},

   abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of remittances on household consumption instability in a large panel of developing countries. There are four main results. First, remittances significantly reduce household consumption instability. Second, remittances play an insurance role by dampening the effects of various sources of consumption instability in developing countries (natural disasters, agricultural shocks, discretionary fiscal policy, systemic financial and banking crises and exchange rate instability). Third, the stabilizing role played by remittances is stronger in less financially developed countries. Fourth, the overall stabilizing effect of remittances is mitigated when remittances exceed 6% of GDP. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {The study has three main findings. First, when compared to what they would have spent without the receipt of remittances, households receiving remittances spend less at the margin on one key consumption good: food. Second, households receiving remittances spend more at the margin on three important investment goods: education, housing, and health. Third, the receipt of remittances greatly reduces the likelihood of household poverty. These findings support the growing view that remittances can reduce poverty and increase human and physical capital investment in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impact of internal remittances (from Ghana) and international remittances (from African or other countries) on investment and poverty in Ghana. It has three findings.
